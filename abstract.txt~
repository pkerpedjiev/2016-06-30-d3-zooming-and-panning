Visualizing Co-Transcriptional Folding
--------------------------------------

Researchers often consider the structue of an RNA molecule as not only a static
molecule, but a ready-made secondary-structure complete molecule. Too little
thought is often given to the sequence of pairing and unpairing events that
occur while an RNA is being transcribed. Driven by energetic, kinetic, and
steric constraints nascent transcripts are dynamic entities that simultaneously
populate multiple secondary structure configurations. Using tools from the
Vienna RNA package, we calculate the population of strutures that are present
in solution at each step in the transcription process and assign them a
concentration relative to each other. Armed with this information, we look for
ways to present this information in a meaningful manner that gives researchers
a clear picture of how an RNAs structure evolves as it is elongated.

The first, an animation, focuses on the sequence of pairing - unpairing events
that occur over the course of the transcription process and result in the
predicted minimum free energy structure. This provides an intuitive description
of the folding process of an RNA molecule and aims to illustrate that
large-scale rearrangements of the secondary structure can occur as it is being
transcribed. The second is a static representation of the different structures
and their relative concentrations at each step of transcription.  It shows how
kinetic considerations can lead to the domination of energetically suboptimal
structures in the population of nascent transcripts. Together, these depictions
aim to not only portray, but to provide insight into the effects of
thermodynamic kinetics in the process of RNA folding during transcription.
